Hi, I'm Felix, currently working as a research associate and PhD student at
the [Software & Digital Business Group](https://www.is.tu-darmstadt.de/fachgebiet_is/index.en.jsp)
of Technical University of Darmstadt. Here, my time is split up between doing 
research in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) and advising cybersecurity startups.
I am also an independent Data Science consultant. Please have a look at my
[dedicated page](/consulting) to see what I am able to offer to help you and your business.

### Research

Ever since my Masters degree studies in Information Systems, my main interests
lie in applying machine learning techniques to real-world problems. In detail,
my research interests include:

- Ethical AI: transparency, fairness, safety, privacy and accountability for intelligent systems
- Economical impact of AI: business models for ML-driven products, organization of ML teams
- Technological development related to ML: deep reinforcement learning, Bayesian modeling

### Work with startups

During my studies, my business partner and I ran a web agency for more than 
five years. At TUD, I can use my practical experience to help passionate founders
in the area of cybersecurity and advise them on the following:

- developing valid business models following the LEAN methodology and data-driven
approaches
- securing public funding in order to enable growth

### Other interests

Besides my research and work, I am interested in the following areas:

- mixed martial arts (MMA)
- tennis (Roger Federer is my all-time favorite athlete)
