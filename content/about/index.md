Hi, I'm Felix, currently working as a research associate and PhD student at
the [information systems chair](https://www.is.tu-darmstadt.de/fachgebiet_is/index.en.jsp)
of TU Darmstadt. Here, my time is split up between doing research in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) and advising cybersecurity startups.

### Research

Ever since my Masters degree studies in Information Systems, my main interests
lie in applying machine learning techniques to real-world problems. In detail,
my research interests include:

- prediction of tweet popularity through transfer learning (see [GitHub](https://github.com/felixpeters/retweet-prediction))
- effects of AI on business models and human-machine collaboration
- how to guarantee AI safety and deal with black-box systems in regulated environments

### Work with startups

My business partner and I have been running a [web agency](https://albrechtpeters.de/) 
for more than five years. At TUD, I have the opportunity to work with passionate
founders in the area of cybersecurity and advise them on the following:

- developing valid business models following the LEAN methodology and data-driven
approaches
- securing public funding in order to enable growth

### Data science freelancing

I am constantly looking for challenging and interesting projects in the realm
of data science and machine learning. Through my research, study and previous
work, I am experienced in the following areas:

- running real-world data science projects end-to-end, from business case development to deployment
- training deep neural networks on computer vision and natural language processing
tasks
- understanding and implementing complex algorithms (e.g., Gaussian Processes, EM) 
from scratch
- building web applications with languages like Go, JS (React, node.js) and
databases like PostgreSQL and MongoDB
- working with container-based systems on cloud infrastructure (AWS, Google
Cloud platform, Paperspace Gradient)

Currently, I am diving deeper into deep probabilisitc programming and Bayesian
methods in general.
If you are interested in elaborating on new projects, please feel gree to contact
me via the channels listed on this site.

### Other interests

Besides my research and work, I am interested in the following areas:

- mixed martial arts (MMA)
- tennis (Roger Federer is my all-time favorite athlete)
