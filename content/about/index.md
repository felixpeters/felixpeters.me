Hi, I'm Felix, currently working as a research associate and PhD student at
the [information systems chair](https://www.is.tu-darmstadt.de/fachgebiet_is/index.en.jsp)
of TU Darmstadt. As my day job, I **advise IT security start-ups** about business
model development and securing public funding. At night, **my research is focused
on artificial and machine learning**, more precisely:

- popularity prediction in social networks (see [GitHub](https://github.com/felixpeters/tweet-engagement-prediction))
- effects of AI on business models
- moral and ethical consequences of AI adoption

Since I possess a **Masters degree in business information systems**, I combine
technical and business skills.
