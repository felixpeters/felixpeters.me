Hi, I'm Felix, currently working as a research associate and PhD student at
the [information systems chair](https://www.is.tu-darmstadt.de/fachgebiet_is/index.en.jsp)
of TU Darmstadt. As my day job, I **advise IT security start-ups** about business
model development and securing public funding. At night, **my research is focused
on artificial and machine learning**, more precisely:

- prediction of tweet popularity (see [GitHub](https://github.com/felixpeters/tweet-engagement-prediction))
- effects of AI on business models
- moral and ethical consequences of AI adoption

Since I possess a **Masters degree in business information systems**, I combine
technical and business skills. On the technical side, my graduate studies 
mainly comprised machine learning courses and enabled me to:

- understand complex algorithms (e.g., Gaussian Processes, EM) and implement
them from scratch
- run a real-world data science project end-to-end
- learn about classical AI problems, e.g., search and planning
- train deep neural networks on novel tasks like retweet prediction

Moreover, my partner and I have been running a [web agency](https://albrechtpeters.de/) for more than
five years. Thus, I am **experienced in building web applications**, applying
technologies like Go, JavaScript (React, Node.js) and different kinds of
databases (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB). As an entrepreneur, I am always **interested
in exciting projects in the area of data science and machine learning**. Please
feel free to contact me via the channels listed on this site.

Besides my research and work, I am interested in the following areas:

- mixed martial arts (MMA)
- tennis (Roger Federer is my all-time favorite athlete)
- probabilistic programming and Bayesian methods
